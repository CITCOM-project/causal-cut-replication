## Data

**Some of the data in this directory is redacted**

Due to the terms of their data sharing agreement, we cannot share data from the [OpenAPS data commons](https://openaps.org/outcomes/data-commons), nor can we share the patient ID of the individual whose trace we used to extract attack traces for the system.
We carried out considerable preprocessing of the data in order to clean it and make it suitable for our purposes.
If you wish to replicate this part of our study, please [apply for access](https://openaps.org/outcomes/data-commons) to the data and then contact us for further information.
However, our study is primarily carried out using simulated data, which we will make publicly available and link from this README file once we finish running our experiments.
Please contact us if we forget to do this.
