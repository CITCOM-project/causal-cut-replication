# Temporal Causal Testing
This repository contains the replication package for our temporal causal testing paper.

## Pre-requisites
We use an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) virtual environment.
This is not strictly necessary, but you will need Python>=3.10, and will need to adapt the setup and replication instructions accordingly.

##Setup
1. Clone the repository.
1. Create a new virtual environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml --name tci
```
